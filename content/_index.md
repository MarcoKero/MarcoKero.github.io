#        ðŸ“š My Research focus is on developing intelligent interaction systems that bridge the gap between humans and machines, with applications in Industry 4.0, human-robot collaboration, and immersive interfaces.
#        Over the years, Iâ€™ve designed and evaluated novel benchmarks for online 3D gesture recognition, created XR applications for remote monitoring and control, and collaborated internationally with academic and industrial partners. My work combines AI-driven methods (including deep learning and data augmentation) with a user-centered approach to interaction design.
